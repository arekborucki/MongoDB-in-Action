# Chapter 2 – Getting Started with Atlas and MongoDB Data

This folder contains examples and setup steps for **Chapter 2** of the book *MongoDB 8.0 in Action*.  
It introduces MongoDB Atlas, the Atlas CLI, sample datasets, and working with databases, collections, and documents.

## 📘 What you’ll learn in this chapter

- How to install and use the MongoDB Atlas CLI
- How to create organizations, projects, clusters, users, and IP access
- Loading sample data sets into a free-tier cluster
- Connecting to a cluster using `mongosh`
- Managing data using databases, collections, and documents
- Creating capped collections, time series collections, and views
- Using dynamic schemas and understanding MongoDB’s document model

## 📁 Files in this folder

This chapter is mostly setup-based, but example shell commands are provided in the book and can be adapted into scripts if needed.

You can optionally add your own helper scripts here, for example:

- `connect.sh` – connect to your Atlas cluster using mongosh
- `createUser.sh` – create MongoDB users from CLI
- `sampleQuery.js` – basic sample document operations
