# Chapter 21 ‚Äì Operational Excellence with MongoDB Atlas

This directory contains examples and CLI snippets from **Chapter 21** of _MongoDB 8.0 in Action_.  
It focuses on achieving operational reliability and performance using **MongoDB Atlas tools** such as backup, restore, monitoring, and alerting.

---

## üöÄ What You'll Learn

- How to configure and manage **Cloud Backups** (including point-in-time and snapshot-based)
- How to **restore** clusters using snapshots, timestamps, or to alternate environments
- Real-time and historical **performance monitoring** with:
  - Performance Advisor
  - Query Profiler
  - Real-Time Performance Panel (RTPP)
  - Namespace Insights
- How to run **MongoDB native diagnostic commands** (e.g., `serverStatus`, `currentOp`, `top`)
- How to configure **alerts and logging**
- Best practices for **upgrading Atlas clusters** (minor and major)

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- **MongoDB Atlas CLI**: [`atlascli`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/)
- **MongoDB 8.0+**
- **Atlas project** and M10+ cluster for full feature access
- Tools:
  - [`mongodump`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongodump/) ‚Äì for creating logical backups  
  - [`mongorestore`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongorestore/) ‚Äì for restoring BSON dumps  
  - [`mongosh`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/) ‚Äì MongoDB shell

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- **M0 and Flex clusters** have limited backup/restore capabilities ‚Äì no on-demand snapshots or point-in-time recovery.
- Always test restore procedures in staging environments.
- Use **Performance Advisor** and **Query Profiler** to identify inefficient queries and improve indexing.
- Alerts should be configured for production clusters to catch CPU steal, query targeting, and connection limits.
- Native MongoDB commands (e.g., `db.currentOp()`, `db.serverStatus()`) are powerful tools for deeper inspection.
