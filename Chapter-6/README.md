# Chapter 6 ‚Äì Building Aggregation Pipelines

This directory contains examples and explanations from **Chapter 6** of *MongoDB 8.0 in Action*.  
It focuses on the MongoDB Aggregation Framework and how to use pipelines for efficient data analysis, transformation, and reporting.

---

## üîç What you'll learn

- How the aggregation framework works in MongoDB
- Writing aggregation pipelines with `db.collection.aggregate()`
- Key stages like:
  - `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, `$limit`, `$project`, `$set`, `$unset`, `$unwind`
- Using `$lookup` for joining collections
- Writing and saving aggregation results using `$merge` and `$out`
- Working with:
  - Accumulators (`$sum`, `$avg`, `$max`, `$min`)
  - Array deconstruction with `$unwind`
- Replacing `$project` with `$set` and `$unset` for clarity and flexibility
- Creating MongoDB views using `$lookup`
- Using `$mergeObjects` with `$lookup` for flattening documents
- Leveraging the Aggregation Pipeline Builder in MongoDB Atlas
- Best practices for performance and pipeline optimization

## üí° Tips

- Use `$match` as early as possible in the pipeline to reduce processed documents.
- Replace `$project` with `$set`/`$unset` unless you‚Äôre restructuring documents.
- Ensure fields used in `$sort` and `$lookup` are indexed for performance.
- Be cautious when using `$lookup` in high-traffic collections‚Äîdenormalization may be better.
