- How to build rich, interactive dashboards with **MongoDB Atlas Charts**
- How to generate visualizations using **natural language queries**
- How to create a **custom billing dashboard**
- How to use **Atlas Triggers** for real-time, serverless event handling
- How to write **Atlas Functions** in JavaScript to execute complex logic
- How to build fully reactive and event-driven applications without managing backend infrastructure

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- **MongoDB Atlas Account**
- **Sample dataset**: `sample_restaurants`
- **Atlas Charts** enabled
- **Atlas App Services** enabled
- Basic understanding of:
  - Change Streams
  - JavaScript (ES6+)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **Natural Language Charts** currently rely on Microsoft Azure OpenAI (subject to change).
- Trigger execution depends on the **ordering setting** ‚Äì unordered triggers support up to **10,000 concurrent events**.
- Each **Atlas Trigger** is linked to a corresponding **Atlas Function**.
- For scheduled operations, you can define **CRON expressions** for flexible automation.
- Atlas Functions are **serverless** and support full **JavaScript/Node.js** functionality with access to **external APIs** and **npm packages**.
