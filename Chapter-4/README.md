# Chapter 4 ‚Äì Executing CRUD Operations

This directory contains code examples and scripts for **Chapter 4** of *MongoDB 8.0 in Action*.  
It walks through how to create, read, update, and delete documents using the `mongosh` shell, with a strong focus on real-world use of update operators, array handling, and advanced querying.

## üîç What you'll learn

- Inserting documents with `insertOne()` and `insertMany()`
- Updating documents using `$set`, `$inc`, `$push`, `$pull`, `$addToSet`, `$elemMatch`, and array filters
- Replacing full documents with `replaceOne()`
- Deleting documents with `deleteOne()` and `deleteMany()`
- Running advanced read queries using:
  - Logical and comparison operators
  - Array and embedded document filters
  - Regular expressions
  - Projections and sorting
- Executing multiple operations with `bulkWrite()`
- Using cursors for iteration and pagination
- Leveraging the Stable API to ensure compatibility across MongoDB upgrades
